Caitlin's background is in quantitative ecology where she studied the consequences of resource management's imperfect knowledge of resource systems, and how to best aggregate information into ecological indices that can be used to inform managers and policy makers. She has an Integrated Sciences undergraduate degree from the University of British Columbia and a Master's degree from Simon Fraser University. Her primary interest throughout her academic career has been in how data and science is communicated to policy makers, managers and the general public, and how it can be improved through quantitative techniques, data analysis and media.

Caitlin was involved in a data journalism project by Discourse Media called Moving Forward which discussed the future of transportation in Metro Vancouver. The project's objective was to dive deeper into the data surrounding the referendum, and communicate this information to a broad audience through data visualizations, interactive applications and maps,  infographics and written content. The project was a finalist in the 2015 Knight Foundation's data journalism awards for Best Journalism Website of the Year.

Caitlin is currently in a Web Development Immersive program where she is improving her programming skills in Ruby, Javascript, Rails, and more. She hopes to use these skills to improve data and science communication.
